        <p><i>Even though much has been done since the creation of the Euro Area banking union, this ambitious project relies on an institutional framework that is still under construction. We interviewed <a class="hightext" href="https://twitter.com/nicolas_veron" target="_blank">Nicolas Véron </a>, Senior Fellow at <a class="hightext" href="http://bruegel.org/" target="_blank">Bruegel </a>, which he co-founded, and Visiting Fellow at the <a class="hightext" href="http://www.iie.com/" target="_blank">Peterson Institute for International Economics</a>, in order to understand the state-of-the-art of this unfinished project.</i></p>

        <h3>The Commission is about to introduce a <a class="hightext" href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-6051_en.htm" target="_blank">proposal on a European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS)</a>, which is the third pillar of the banking union. What is the nature of this proposal and what would this imply for the Euro Area?</h3>
        <p>The banking union remains incomplete if the depositors have different types of protection depending on where they are located inside the Euro Area. Deposit insurance is different from resolution, because it is about retail depositors’ trust. During turbulent times, when depositors might doubt the robustness of the national deposit guarantee system, the heterogeneity of schemes can create an incentive for them to move their deposits from one part of the Euro Area to another. In the end this could be a channel for crisis and contagion, and could trigger the bank-sovereign vicious circle again.<br><br>Regarding the specific Commission proposal, we need to wait until the details are revealed. In order to be aligned with the objective stated above, it will need to be extremely clear and predictable so that all depositors can trust the new scheme. Otherwise, adding complexity to our current system may create uncertainty and ultimately lead to operational risk.</p>

        <h3>Is it politically feasible that this proposal becomes a legislative act in the short term?</h3>
        <p>According to a <a class="hightext" href="http://blogs.ft.com/brusselsblog/files/2015/09/Nonpaperfinal_20150910091345.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> leaked in early September, there is list of conditions required by Germany that should be fulfilled before making any movement towards risk mutualization, which are almost impossible to meet in the near future. Even though this paper is not an official position of the German government, it gives an indication of the political stance. Thus discussions can be expected to be difficult, but that shouldn’t mean any progress is impossible. </p>

        <h3>What is the role that a well-framed common guarantee scheme could play in a potential Euro Area exit scenario as the one experienced by Greece in early July?</h3>
        <p>The scenario of Grexit in the early summer of 2015 was an extreme case of the bank-sovereign vicious circle. Neither the Greek government nor its Euro Area creditors aimed at Grexit, but there was a possibility that the negotiation deadlock would lead to a collapse of the banking system after which Grexit would become the only practical option. Based on the experience of Cyprus in 2013, Greek depositors had reasons to fear for their deposits’ safety. As a consequence, taking these deposits out of the Greek banks, even if it was not related to banks’ weaknesses, was a rational move. Deposit flight, in turn, increased the reliance on increasing amounts of Emergency Liquidity Assistance which became more difficult to justify as the Greek government’s stance appeared to harden with the referendum, and this did increase the probability of an exit. A European Deposit Insurance Scheme would have reduced the likelihood of that scenario since depositors would have felt better protected from the outset. A vicious circle of the sort we saw earlier this year cannot be made impossible, but it would be much less likely to happen if European deposit insurance was in place.<br><br>There is a body of opinion, largely but not only in Germany, which believes that the threat of Grexit from the Euro Area was a good way to address moral hazard. But such a threat is actually counter-productive because any exit from the Euro Area is a negative-sum game which in the end threatens the entire Euro Area. The leaked German government paper implicitly endorses this more enlightened view by referring to the objective to break the bank-sovereign vicious circle. In the end, the creation of the European Deposit Insurance Scheme is a logical consequence of the commitment to defend the integrity of the Euro Area. It would also put an end to any strategy that uses the threat of exit or “timeout” as a negotiating device, as was seen in action in early July.</p>

        <h3>Another source of risk relates to the fact that banks hold home sovereign debt. What are the main proposals to address this dimension of the bank-sovereign vicious link?</h3>
        <p>There are two main sets of proposals being considered to address this issue, one with risk weighting and another with exposure limits. The first one raises the problem of who is going to do the risk weighting assessment. The US subprime crisis showed that rating agencies have their limitations. Each bank could be asked to make their own risk assessment, but it would probably lead to significant discrepancies among banks for the assessment of the same sovereign, which will be hard to justify. Furthermore, no public institution, such as the ECB or the IMF, is willing to take the decision of weighting sovereign risks themselves. Mercifully, this problem of assignation of authority would not arise with the alternative route, namely limits on exposure to each Euro Area sovereign formulated as a maximum ratio of a bank’s exposure to its regulatory capital. This would apply automatically, with no need for anyone’s judgement. Banks would just have to diversify. One problem here could be the transition, which could be disruptive in some scenarios. This route would also create constraints for government spending by removing an option of financial repression, but that could actually be seen as a benefit. As for the transition challenge, it could certainly be managed, especially in a context of QE.</p>

        <h3>Are any of these proposals politically feasible in the short term?</h3>
        <p>On sovereign-debt exposures, the debate has moved very slowly for the moment. Even though Ms Nouy has publicly advocated for exposure limits for more than a year, there appears to be no consensus within the ECB. There also seems to be no majority in the SSM’s supervisory board to make a decision. One reason may be that the home bias is large not only in Southern countries, but also in public banks in Germany for example.</p>

        <h3>In the scenario where the third pillar is finished and the home bias holding of the sovereign debt problem is tackled, will the two-way vicious circle of banks and sovereign be broken?</h3>
        <p>These are the two most visible channels of the bank-sovereign vicious circle, namely government guarantees to banks on the one hand, including deposit guarantee, and banks’ home-country sovereign debt portfolios on the other hand. They are powerful channels of contagion, the first from banks to sovereigns and the second from sovereigns to bank. That being said, links between banks and sovereigns are much more multifaceted and have many different threads. It could be too simplistic and even misleading to see the vicious circle only through these two mechanisms.</p>

        <h3>One issue that goes beyond these two main channels is ring-fencing, but not much has been done about it...</h3>
        <p>This is another big policy issue which the SSM has not yet been able to fully tackle. National authorities can impose limitations on the intragroup allocation of capital and liquidity and thus prevent a bank from operating as a single entity across Euro Area member states. ECB Executive Board member Peter Praet has noted in a recent interview with Bloomberg that as long as there is such ring-fencing, there can be no complete banking union. Whether ring-fencing is justified on grounds of resolution and deposit insurance is a legitimate topic for political leaders to consider and weigh against the objective of breaking the bank-sovereign linkage. The ECB cannot tackle this issue alone, not least since national authorities have a majority in the SSM supervisory board.</p>

        <h3>In one of his last interviews, the <a class="hightext" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2015/html/sp151117.en.html" target="_blank">ECB’s Peter Praet</a> referred to the introduction of European banking licenses in order to allow for a European bank to be able to operate in the Euro Area as a single entity. What is your interpretation of this?</h3>
        <p>I understand this as a (welcome) attempt to stimulate the policy debate rather than as a detailed proposal at this stage. In technical terms, the banking license is European and granted by the SSM. But because of ring-fencing and of differences in national regimes such as insolvency law, this license has a different economic value depending on where in the Euro Area a bank is incorporated. Ideally, a European banking license should entail an entirely European legal regime in all aspects of banking regulation, perhaps even going all the way to bank taxation. This would make it impossible for a government to unilaterally raise sector-specific taxes on banks, as President Victor Orban has done a few years ago in Hungary. It is a relevant question whether that should be possible in a banking union or not. Less utopian at this point, a single insolvency regime for Euro Area banks would be necessary for the resolution regime (which is legally defined as an alternative to insolvency) to merit its label as “single”. </p>

        <h3>Finally, much is being said these days about the creation of a <a class="hightext" href="http://ec.europa.eu/finance/capital-markets-union/index_en.htm" target="_blank">Capital Market Union</a> in Europe. What is the link between this new project and the banking union?</h3>
        <p>The capital market union remains a loosely defined project, even after almost a year and a half of discussions, a green paper, and an action plan. From a policy perspective, it is still at an early stage. What is reasonably clear from President Juncker’s initial announcement of it in July 2014 is that it aims to reduce the dominant share of banking in the EU’s financial system. For this, it will eventually need to include more policy reforms than have been announced so far. The ECB has been very supportive of the vision of a more developed and better integrated European capital market. It has not subscribed to defensive claims against CMU that have been made by some segments of the European banking industry. On the contrary, the ECB had suggested that more developed and better integrated capital markets would imply further risk sharing in a way that would be good for financial stability. So, even though the banking union project has been much more impactful so far compared to CMU, in policy terms the vision of a better developed and integrated European capital market is very consistent with the vision of banking union.</p>
